**MISSION CRITICAL:** Identify the TOP 15 HIGH-VALUE KEYWORDS that the top 3 SERP competitors ARE NOT covering but SHOULD BE.

**ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:**

1. **SEMANTIC GAP DETECTION:**
   - Analyze competitor snippets for missing subtopics
   - Identify questions they fail to answer
   - Find semantic entities they ignore
   - Spot outdated information gaps

2. **USER INTENT MAPPING:**
   - What problems do users have that competitors don't solve?
   - What follow-up questions remain unanswered?
   - What comparison/decision information is missing?
   - What \${TARGET_YEAR} updates are they missing?

3. **OPPORTUNITY SCORING (1-100):**
   - Search Volume Potential (40%)
   - Competition Gap Size (30%)
   - Commercial Intent (20%)
   - Content Feasibility (10%)

4. **KEYWORD SELECTION CRITERIA:**
   - MUST be semantically related to primary topic
